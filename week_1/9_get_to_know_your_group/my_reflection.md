Hey guys!
Challenge 9 of week 1 includes sending an email to our accountability group so here it is.

My name is Evan Simoni. I will be attending the San Francisco Bootcamp (I think we all are, right?) and right now I’m living in the Russian Hill neighborhood of SF.

My three favorite websites are:
www.medium.com
www.soundcloud.com
www.mrmoneymustache.com

My Gregorc Thinking Style is Concrete Sequential.

My learning style is Multi-Modal Type II meaning I like to accrue as much available information from each of the learning styles before moving on.

OK, I think that’s it for now. Looking forward to meeting all of you in person!

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

It's been great to be able to read other people's reactions to the fireside chat and to have them express their fears so openly. It gives me some comfort in the fact that this is a shared experience and we are all in this together, but willing to support each other too. This week was pretty hectic given that it wwas the first week of phase 0 work. It was definitely more than I anticipated but I'm looking forward better allocating my time and effort in the coming weeks. I really want to make the most of this and now that I have an idea of how much work will be required, I'm confident that I can do a better job prioritizing.
