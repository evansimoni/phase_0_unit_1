## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a new repository on GitHub (assuming you are signed into your account) click the '+' button next to your username in the upper right. A menu will pop up--click 'new repository'. Once the repository has been created, click the 'clone in desktop' button, located on the lower right side of the page (you must have GitHub for Mac or Windows already installed on your local system). A copy will be made on your computer.

Open source is a term describing software that is free to be used, edited and distributed by anyone. It means the source can be viewed by anyone and it not necessarily proprietary to a single owner. Open source usually implies that there are many people who have contributed code to a project or program.

Open source seems like the best way for great software to be made. I imagine that the more ideas and contributions that come in, the better the software will be--well at least the option of implementing all of the proposed changes seems to lend credence to this idea. I assume the effectiveness with which open source changes are implemented depends on a case by case basis. It makes me neither nervous or protective since I have not yet written any software of my own, but I imagine I would like to contribute to open source projects.

Licenses are important because they set the terms on how other people can interact with your software. If terms are never set, then there is no legal basis for any kind of intellectual property protections. On the other hand, a license can be used to explcitly state that software may be edited, modified or resold. This is good for creators who want to legally share their work and have it built upon by others but retain some credit. In short, licenses are important for setting transparent terms of use.

This challenge helped me better understand how GitHub for Mac is connected to the online version of GitHub and my file directory. I guess you could say this was an 'aha' moment, except it was more like '...oh. oh. aaaaahhh. haaaa'

I did not look for any additional sources on this challenge--the instructions alone were clear enough.
