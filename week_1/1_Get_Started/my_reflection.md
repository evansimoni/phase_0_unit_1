## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Installing git on my computer and signing up for GitHub were a breeze--however I did encounter a small problem when I was setting up GitHub in git through the command line. I don't recall excatly how it happened, but my full name got cut off when I entered in my GitHub credentials. It may have been due to an erroniously placed apostrophe. Nevertheless I was able to googlefind a solution to change my user name using the command line. I learned that I'll have to pay very careful attention when I type my credentials / commands in general into the command line.

Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is a version control technology that runs locally on your computer and is controlled using the command line. It saves snapshots of files as you modify them over time. GitHub integrates with git by providing an online space for your project files to be stored and their changes to be tracked. It also enables many people to collaborate on the same files at once and merge their changes together in GitHub's online repository.

Version control is the process of tracking changes to a file or set of files over time. It keeps snapshots of different interations and allows users to revert to any version at any time. GitHub is useful in that is keeps a backup copy of a users local files while also making them available to others for collobartive purposes.

Developers use version control to keep track of their changes. It also allows them to experiment with different coding approcahes without the risk of overwriting previous code. They get to see what works best by creating a few versions and then choosing which one they'd like to move forward with. They can also go back and use another version if they change their mind because git will always keep a version once it has been committed. This actually makes a lot of sense. I'm not surprised to learn that it is so popular.

At this point I have a pretty good conceptual understanding of the utility of git and GitHub but I really don't understand how they work from a technical perspective. Like, how are changes merged? How are different file versions consolidated into one master version? How do pushes and pulls work, exactly? How does it feel to collaborate with HitHub? I'm sure that many of these concerns will be addressed soon but having jumped into reading about these technologies I am getting anxious about actually using them. I'm looking forward to learning through experiecneing them.
