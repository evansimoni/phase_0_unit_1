## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that this is actually a difference between the internet and the world wide web. For so long I had referred to them interchangeably. But the distinction makes perfect sense to me now. I was also unsure about the W3C's role in internet standards, but now it is clear that they keep an offical record of the latest standards (without any ability to enforce them).

When you set up an HTML site it is important to remember that you must have a domain name registered and you must also have hosting. Often times you can get both of these through the same service (such as godaddy) but you may also sign up for them seperately (or even host your website yourself!)

I was pretty stoked to see my webpage live. As far as I know this was the first time a locally created file has been uploaded and hosted on the internet! I have created website through other services and edited files remotely but I will also remeber this one as My First Webpage! Yeee!

I'm still trying to wrap my head around all of GitHub's features and to see how they play out in syncing between the website, the app and my local directories. I really want to understand this so I can stop worrying and move past it! No 'aha' moment here, yet.

I want to install Sublime tools in the command line but have been unsuccesful after one attempt. I will try again tomorrow. I am trying to follow directions at the following link:
