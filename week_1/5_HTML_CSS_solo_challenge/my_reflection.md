I had a few questions come up during this challenge. I wasn't sure how to have the side bar and main content sit sid by side (float) or how to align all the contents in the center of the page (inside of their own div with the margins on auto). I solved these problems by consulting the css documentation on W3C.

One concept I'm so sure about at this point is when it's acceptable to use % to position something. It seems like it works positioning floating divs horizontally within a containing div but it was not working to position my div over my picture vertically (but it did move horizontally with a percentage value).

I learned that I can size a photo using percentage values corresponding to the size of the containing div.

I am mostly confident with the Learning Competencies. The one thing that has me a little tripped up is the relative/fixed/static positioning and the placement of divs. I will need to spend some extra time studying this part. I am very confident in my understanding of how html tags work and how they tie in with css id's and classes.

I really enjoyed adding css to my page. It's what lets me add a little flavor. I'm looking forward to getting more creative with my css as I learn more methods moving forward.

I though creating the skeleton of html and positioning the divs correctly was the most tedious part.
