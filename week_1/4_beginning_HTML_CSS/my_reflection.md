## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I've spent a decent amount of time around HTML at this point so it's really starting to make sense in my mind. I think can look at it and understand everything that is going on in the structure of a website (that is until I encounter some super complex site that I could never have imagined XD lol).

The good thing about HTML is how straightforward it is to understand. There's no logic to it, just structure. And there's no cryptic looking text or symbols either. The only drawback is the excessive use of tags. I'm getting tired of < and > ! Just kidding... kinda. I like how ruby has removed the majority of these computery characters.

I have worked with HTML and CSS before so my 'aha' moment related to these topics came much earlier in my coding career. I'd say the big 'aha' moment for me was understanding how the HTML and CSS files are linked together and work together in the same directory to display a page.

In this case I only used the sources that were cited to help me complete the challenge.
