Blog url: http://evansimoni.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I absolutely had a fun researching and writing a blog post. Writing is something that I've always enjoyed but I rarely do--it defintely helped to be prompted to do this. Not to mention analyzing design and user experience is the kind of thing that I'm really into. It was also fun to think about why I like each of the websites that I chose--this isn't something that I would normally do. So far, I'm not aware of any comments or views (I'm actually not sure where I could find this).

I actually enjoyed creating the blog. It prompted me to research some functions that I knew were possible and it was fun to actually see them implemented into my design. I think I learned a lot in the process. I clocked in 4-5 hours to do the blog template. I really hope I can improve on my speed in the near future! I feel good about understanding the relationship between elements and atrributes in the html and css files but I'm less confident when it comes to understanding the arrangement/layout/relationships of divs. I'm also not very confortable with my design decisions, I would love to create more beautiful websites than this blog XD.
