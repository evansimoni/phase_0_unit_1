## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I learned that design and user experience design does not necessarily follow a single process or flow. It turns out it depends a lot of the goal/line of business and on who is directing/approving a project design. I also learned that design is an iterative process and oftentimes many avenues mist be explored to decide what will work best.

At this point I think I like user experience and design. Since I took an interest in programming I learned about UI and UX and seemed to find myself looking for ways to improve other people's work when I noticed a bad design or bad experience. So in a sense, I've been training myself already :) I enjoyed using the wireframing tool Mockingbird, it was pretty simple and offered just enough stuff to create a skeltal design. However I don't know what to expect when I try to use it to make my own wireframe.

My biggest question this challenge was to figure out what would be the best/most intuitive wireframing tool to use. I settled on Mockingbird after reading a few reviews because it was free to try and had a lot of baisc elements that I could drag-drop and resize.

There weren't any concepts I struggled with this time.

I learned a few cool tricks and developed a nice flow while working in Mockingbird.

I am very confident that I understand the Learning Competencies of this challenge.

I enjoyed making the wireframe and examining how some of my favorite websites look when exposed as a wireframe. It reinforced some of what I wrote about in my technical blog.

The most tedious part of this challenge was wireframing SoundCloud. They have so many elements on their website! As I said in my technical blog, their interface is too busy.
