# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

At this point, my biggest time management challenge during phase 0 has been deciding when I will be completing the work for the week. I am still working 40 hours a week and, while I am able to accomplish some of the DBC stuff in my free time at work, it is tough to get even more done afterward because I am tired and less focused.
 
It's looking like the weekends are going to be my most productive crunch times. Not to say that I will not be working during the weekdays. I have set aside times and locations each day after work for DBC work (cafes and libraries).
 
One of my favorite techniques is choosing small tasks, working on them until they are complete, and then taking a short break to read, social-mediaize or meditate. I will probably stick with this one because it has worked for me in the past.
 
My overall plan for phase 0 is to keep with my schedule that I have created. I will make exceptions on a case by case basis (when social gatherings arise) but weekdays after work and Saturdays will stay devoted to DBC phase 0 work. I will continue reading and doing whatever work I can during my free time on my job. I also plan on quitting my job 3 weeks before DBC in-class beings to drive down the coast to spend time with friends and family before I begin. During this period I will make sure to get DBC done by setting aside time to work in the mornings when most people are busy with other things.
