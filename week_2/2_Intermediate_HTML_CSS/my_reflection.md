# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think web standards are a good idea beacause they enable developers to write code that works everywhere. Having a standard for everything is great because it elimintaes the necessity for redudant code. I notice that in some cases there are competing standards and redundant code is inevitable. I suppose the most effective standard will win out in time.

The more I work with the standard structure, the more it makes sense to me. It makes sense to give pieces of the document more specific names, this lets you and others more easily understand your code.

I would like to get more familiar with all the possible tag names and use them whenever possible. Emannuel, my GPS lead informed me that this is good for SEO. I like them because they make it easier to identify which part of your document youre targeting.

reset.css is necessary because it sets a standard baseline for you to build the rest of your css on. This has become a convention because all broswers have some default css applied to elements to make a page readble in case there are no styles defined.

I primarily use Chrome, but I have noticed that pages will render differently in Safari and in IE. I've noticed IE makes pages looks the worst. I think it's neither good nor bad, but just what could be expected from competing enterprises. They will build different products.

I looked at the HTML5 element index at http://html5doctor.com/element-index/ to give me a sense of what tags I could use in the practice document.
