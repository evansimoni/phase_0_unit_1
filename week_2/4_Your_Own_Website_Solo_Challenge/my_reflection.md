# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://evansimoni.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned by doing it, that design and good user experience is an iterative process. I had read the articles stating that it was such but this is the first time I had really sketched out a vision and then created a site.

I did enjoy designing the site and thinking about the user experience. This one was pretty easy to approach because its scope of functionality is so limited. I found that making a wireframe was helpful because it was a way for me to make changes to my vision before I started implementing the code. This probably saved me some time.

My process was very interative. I started off with a skeleton in the html, then filled in some content, then moved on to the css where I was coninually making little tweaks and checking them in the browser. This final part is what took the longest. I was experimenting with different styling in an effort to get it just right but I was also discovering a flow for how to plan out and code css.

I would like my next site/version of this site to have interactive parts (I think this will require javascript) and also make it optimized for mobile. I could totally do that now, but I've spent so much time on it recently that i need to take a break and do it later.

I didn't think it was too difficult to implement the material I learned. I prefer using Google fonts rather than font-face,  I wonder if font-face confers any advanatges over google fonts. I learned how to apply shadows to images which was pretty sweet, I made a cool effect on my avatar image.

I looked at a few resources but I have unfortunately lost track of them. W3C schools is usually one of my resources related to syntax.
