          <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
            <p>
              Pair programming is an agile software development technique in 
              which two programmers work together at one workstation. 
              One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, 
              pointer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. 
              The two programmers switch roles frequently.

              Clayton is originally from Phoenix, AZ. He is a graduate of 
              Arizona State University in 2006. He has lived in Chicago
              since 2008. He spent the last six years working for a marketing
              agency.

              Evan is a 24 year old student from San Diego, CA. He has been
              intrested in programming for a few years and finally decided 
              that he wanted to make a career out of it. Evan was accepted to
              DBC earlier this year and will begin classes in San Francisco in
              July. His other interests include music, politics and travel.

        	<h2>Reflection</h2>
        	<p>
        		I came into this pairing session without expectations because I wanted to be forced to think on my feet. Suprisingly, the challenge that Clayton and I worked on was pretty straightforward. I think this one was so easy because it is meant to be a test of our pair programming and communication skills rather than a test of our technical knowledge. Nevertheless, we did encounter a few technical concepts that we made progress on including HTML5 name-specific tags, float positioning and indentation conventions. I think CLayton and I worked effectively and at a good pace. We finished 95% of the exercise within the hour and we each did about 50% of the work.
