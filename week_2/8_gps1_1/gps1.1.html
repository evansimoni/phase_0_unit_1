          <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
            <p>
              Pair programming is an agile software development technique in 
              which two programmers work together at one workstation. 
              One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, 
              pointer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. 
              The two programmers switch roles frequently.
