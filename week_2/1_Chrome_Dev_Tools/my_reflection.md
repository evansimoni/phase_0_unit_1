# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The DOM is a framework for interpreting the different elements that make up an HTML webpage. It can be visualized as a tree with elements branching off of each other and child elements forming branches off of them. The general concept of the DOM makes sense to me, I think I actually had an understanding of it before I knew what it was called. I understand now though, that it is used to manipulate modules and pieces of a website with JavaScript. I'm still fuzzy on exactly how this works, even after seeing some examples where JS is used.

Chrome Dev tools revealed a lot about the differences between my site and my friend's personal WordPress site. For one, my site had a just a fraction of the code that his had. The WordPress stylesheet was over 2000 lines long and whereas mine was a measly 81 lines. My site also loaded three times faster, probably due to the fact that it has less code and fewer images. I also noticed that the WP site had a lot of JS code built into it (I think WP works off a standard template) and this likely slowed the site down too. My personal site has no JS (at the moment).

I had a mixed experience with Chrome Dev Tools. I found that modifying code on a page and seeing the changes before my eyes was pretty fun and cool. However, none of the tools were intuitive to use or easy to read. I'm not a fan of the user interface, but I suppose they had to do it this way to fit in so many features. Overall, it is more of a pain than a convenience but I may learn to like using it as I witness how others employ its utility.

I think my largest aha moment was along the lines of "aha, so this is how Chrome Dev Tools is used". I say that because I was aware of its existence before but had never really jumped into trying to learning. I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface.

I watched a short video about the DOM that complemented my reading: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ZcldkGlt8
