# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design is the approach one takes to building websites that will look good on any device. So far I have enojoyed learning about it and practicing converting a static site into a responsive one. I think it is good practice because it is an approach that aims to provide the best user experience no matter what platform a site is being viewed on. If done correctly it future-proofs a design to be compatible on devices that haven't been created yet.

Smartphones and tablets have upended web design because they have introduced new common use cases to websites. Moving forward I think all websites will need to consider tablets and mobile as well as consider how their resoltuions might change while also compensating for web-enabled devices that haven't been invanted or aren't popular yet (wearables/google glass?)

I have heard that visually impaired people use the web by having web pages read out to them. I'm not sure how effective this is but I do believe we should design and develop for them, there is probably room to improve the experience.

Conceptually, most of this web design stuff makes sense. I feel like it's been refined by other peoples experiences and intuiton and is now headed in a sensible UI and UX direction. I don't think any of it is stupid, but there are a few aspects of web design that have yet to make sense, such as the JS libraries. I have not worked with them yet so it's no suprise to me that I don't get it, but I'm looking forward to wrapping my head around all of this very soon.

This time around I used the Treehouse videos and W3C schools website to check and double check my approach to the challenges.
